# A Simple CSP Solver using AC3 Algorithm and Backtracking 

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Python&message=3.8%2B&color=blue&style=for-the-badge)

## Overview

This project is a simple Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver implemented in Python. The solver uses the Arc Consistency Algorithm (AC-3) and backtracking search to find solutions for CSP instances defined by variables, domains, and constraints.

## Features

- Implements the AC-3 algorithm for arc consistency.
- Uses backtracking search for solving CSP instances.
- Supports constraints defined as lambda functions.
- Provides a method for enumerating valid pairs based on constraints.
